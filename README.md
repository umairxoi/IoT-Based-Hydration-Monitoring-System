# IoT-Based-Hydration-Monitoring-System
This project focuses on developing an IoT-based hydration monitoring system that analyzes hydration levels using sweat. The system employs the DHT11 sensor, which serves as an indirect indicator of sweat evaporation and hydration status. The ESP32 microcontroller is used for data processing and wireless communication.
The collected data is transmitted to a web-based interface, where hydration levels are displayed as either "Low Hydration" or "High Hydration" based on predefined thresholds. The system provides real-time hydration status, helping users monitor their fluid levels effectively.

Key Components:
DHT11 Sensor – Measures temperature and humidity
ESP32 Microcontroller – Processes data and enables IoT functionality
Web-Based Dashboard – Displays hydration status in real time
Wireless Connectivity – Uses Wi-Fi to send data to the web interface
Features:
✔ Real-time hydration monitoring
✔ IoT-based remote tracking
✔ Web-based visualization of hydration levels
✔ Low-cost and efficient solution for hydration assessment

This system is ideal for athletes, healthcare applications, and general hydration tracking, ensuring proper fluid balance for optimal health and performance.
