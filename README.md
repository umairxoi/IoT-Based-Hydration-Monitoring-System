# IoT-Based-Hydration-Monitoring-System
This project focuses on developing an IoT-based hydration monitoring system that analyzes hydration levels using sweat. The system employs the DHT11 sensor, which serves as an indirect indicator of sweat evaporation and hydration status. The ESP32 microcontroller is used for data processing and wireless communication.
